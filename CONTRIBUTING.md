- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

**Examples:**

```
feat: Add support for Google Shopping ads

style: Format code with consistent spacing
test: Add tests for edge cases
```

- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

### JavaScript Style Guide

- Use **strict mode**: `'use strict';`
- Use **const** for constants, **let** for variables
- Use **meaningful variable names**
- Add **comments** for complex logic
- Follow **DRY principle** (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Use **arrow functions** where appropriate
- Handle **errors gracefully** with try-catch blocks
- Avoid **global variables**
- Use **template literals** for string interpolation
- Add **JSDoc comments** for functions

**Example:**

```javascript
/**
 * Apply highlight styles to an element
 * @param {HTMLElement} element - The element to highlight
 * @returns {boolean} Success status
 */
function highlightElement(element) {
  if (!element) {
    return false;
  }

  try {
    element.style.border = "2px solid gold";
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to highlight:", error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

## Additional Notes

```
